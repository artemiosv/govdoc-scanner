# Flex GovDoc Scanner

The goal of this project is to develop the Flex GovDoc Scanner, an application that leverages the Node.js stack, AI tools, and cloud services to transform public incorporation documents from Greece's business portal (ΓΕΜΗ, https://publicity.businessportal.gr/) into structured, searchable data. This project aims to facilitate access to essential company information, such as legal representatives, board members, and incorporation history, by offering advanced discovery capabilities through a REST service.

Project Overview:

- Crawl and Index Public Documents: 
  Develop a robust crawling mechanism to gather all relevant PDF documents from the ΓΕΜΗ portal while ensuring compliance with legal standards.
- Extract and Structure Metadata: 
  Utilize AI and OCR technologies to extract key metadata from these documents and store them in a structured format.
- REST Service for Metadata Search: 
  Create an efficient REST API to provide users with search functionalities on the extracted metadata, enabling easy access and analysis.
