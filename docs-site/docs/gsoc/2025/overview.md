# GSoC 2025 Project Overview: GovDoc Scanner

**Mentors**: Giannis E. Skitsas, Vasilis Christopoulos

**Assignee**: Eftihis Drakakis

## Abstract

The GovDoc Scanner project tackles the challenge of accessing and using public company data from the Greek GEMI portal, where information is typically locked in unstructured PDF/DOC/DOCX files. The project delivers a suite of tools that: crawl and download documents, process them using AI (Gemini Flash), and produce structured, searchable metadata with chronological tracking. Outputs are organized per company and consolidated for batch runs, improving transparency and accessibility of public corporate information in Greece.

## Main goals for GSoC 2025

The primary objectives for this project were:

- **Automated Document Crawling**: Develop a robust crawler to navigate the GEMI portal, search for companies using various filters, and download all associated public documents with enhanced date extraction for proper organization.
- **Intelligent Document Processing**: Create an advanced document processing pipeline that can handle different file formats (PDF, DOCX, DOC), extract text, and use Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite to extract comprehensive structured metadata with chronological processing and representative tracking.
- **End-to-End CLI Tool**: Build a unified command-line interface to orchestrate the entire workflow, from crawling and downloading to processing and storing the data, complete with interactive prompts, automated batch processing, progress tracking and error handling.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Establish a documentation site to provide clear instructions for installation, usage, and development, ensuring the project is accessible to a wide audience.

## Implementation

### Crawler Application

The crawler is a Node.js application responsible for interacting with the GEMI portal.

- **Web Scraping and Automation**: `Playwright` powers browser automation (forms, navigation, downloads). `Cheerio` parses portal HTML to extract links and relevant information.
- **Enhanced Date Extraction**: Advanced logic extracts dates from table rows and prepends them to filenames for proper chronological organization.
- **User Interface**: An interactive command-line interface (CLI) was built using `inquirer`, allowing users to easily specify which companies to search for or which GEMI IDs to download documents for.
- **Robust Download System**: `axios` handles HTTP downloads with retries and improved file extension detection. `greek-utils` assists with Greek-specific text; `string-similarity` suggests potential company-name matches.
- **Outputs**: Search results are saved to `apps/crawler/src/ids.txt`. Downloads are organized under `apps/crawler/src/downloads/{GEMI_ID}/document_downloads/` with date-prefixed filenames.

### Document Scanner Application

The doc-scanner application processes the downloaded documents to extract valuable information using advanced AI capabilities.

- **Advanced AI-Powered Analysis**: The scanner uses `@google/generative-ai` with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, enabling specialized analysis of Greek legal documents with prompts for representative identification and Greek corporate terminology.
- **Chronological Processing**: Documents are automatically sorted by date based on filename prefixes, ensuring proper chronological processing to track company evolution over time.
- **Intelligent Metadata Schema**: Expanded schema includes comprehensive company information, detailed representative data (active status, tax IDs, capital shares), and refined field descriptions with duplicate prevention logic.
- **Modular Prompt Architecture**: Specialized prompts are extracted into a dedicated prompts.mjs file, implementing advanced instructions for Greek legal terminology, representative identification, and ownership analysis.
- **Document Text Extraction**: The application supports multiple document formats. `mammoth` is used to extract raw text from `.docx` files, and `word-extractor` handles older `.doc` files.
- **Unified Processing Logic**: A streamlined `processCompanyFiles(files, inputFolder, outputFolder, gemiId, model)` function generates a single comprehensive metadata file, merged chronologically. Incremental logic skips processing when no new files are detected.
- **Environment Management**: The `dotenv` package is used to manage environment variables, keeping sensitive information like API keys out of the source code.
- **Outputs**: When used directly, results are written to `apps/doc-scanner/src/data/output/{GEMI_ID}/{GEMI_ID}_final_metadata.json`.

### CLI Tool Application

The CLI tool serves as a unified interface that orchestrates the complete workflow, combining both crawler and doc-scanner functionality.

- **Interactive Mode**: User-friendly prompts guide users through input methods (file input, manual GEMI ID entry, or random selection) with step-by-step workflow automation.
- **Command-Line Mode**: Non-interactive automation support for batch processing and CI/CD integration with comprehensive argument parsing and error handling.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Seamlessly coordinates the crawler and doc-scanner applications, handling file transfer between components and maintaining processing state.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars and comprehensive summaries with integrated logging system.
- **Advanced Infrastructure**:
  - Integrated configuration validation and API key verification
  - Structured error handling with detailed logging and graceful failure recovery
  - Centralized logging system with progress-aware buffering
- **Usage**: Pass arguments using npmâ€™s "--" separator, for example: `npm start govdoc -- --input ./companies.gds`.
- **Outputs**: Batch outputs are saved under `./output/{GEMI_ID}/` with `{GEMI_ID}_final_metadata.json` and downloaded documents, plus a consolidated `./output/govdoc-output.json` summary.

### Shared Infrastructure & Monorepo

- **NPM Workspaces**: The entire project is managed as a monorepo using NPM workspaces. This simplifies the management of the different applications (`crawler`, `doc-scanner`, `cli`) and shared dependencies, enabling consistent development practices across all components.
- **Shared Modules**: Common infrastructure is centralized under `shared/` including:
  - **Configuration Management**: Centralized environment-aware configuration loading and validation
  - **Logging System**: Module-specific loggers with automatic progress-aware buffering
  - **Progress Management**: Real-time progress bars with integrated log buffering
  - **Error Handling**: Structured error classes for consistent error management across applications
- **Browser Automation**: `playwright` is used for browser automation within the crawler.
- **Development Tools**: Unified error handling, logging, and progress tracking across all applications.
